                    further
                    expanded my skill set, offering opportunities to work on full-stack software projects, gain
                    expertise in

                    a
                    strong foundation in computer engineering, along with a minor and major project experience, I am
                    ready
                    to make significant contributions to cutting-edge software development projects and seek an
                    opportunity
                    to further my career in a challenging and collaborative software engineering role.
